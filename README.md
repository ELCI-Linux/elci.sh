How to use elci.sh:

To use elci.sh, open a terminal and navigate into the for elci.sh folder
type in the following lines into your terminal

bash elci.sh

You will then be prompted to enter your password - this is because the installer uses sudo level priviledges.
elci.sh will then run some software updates and install flatpak onto your system - if you do not wish to install flatpak press 'n' when prompted.

elci.sh will install wget


You will then be prompted to enter your name - this doesn't need to be a username.

Throughout the rest of the process most responses are numerical. 1 is yes, 2 is no.
